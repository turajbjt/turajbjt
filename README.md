- 👋 Hi, I’m James T. [@turajbjt]
- 👀 I’m interests vary, so I'm always trying new things.  Some of my long term intrests include coding (mostly in Perl), web design, computers/networking, 3D printing, wood working, model railroading & gardening, to name a few...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning newer web technologies (such as those related to doing things in the Cloud) & better understanding how to use more mainstream programming languanges.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything specifically.  With a somewhat busy schedule, I just do a little here & there, as free time permits.
- 📫 How to reach me - well you don't.  If you needed to reach me, you would already have my contact info.  If not, then there is likely a reason for it...
